                Generate a precise Boolean search string that helps identify ideal candidates based on the JD. Focus on including relevant:

                - **Relevant job titles or industries**
                
                ### Guidelines
                - Use appropriate Boolean operators: **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **parentheses**.
                - Avoid overly restrictive terms that could limit good candidates.
                - Group synonymous skills or roles together using **OR**.

**Instructions:** 
 - Only include **technical/functional skill areas** in the JD vs Resume Match Table. 
 - Move non-skill-based fields (like Job Location, Time of Joining, Availability) to the Resume Gaps table **if relevant**. 
 - Do not include **“Immediate Joiner”** unless explicitly mentioned in the resume. 
 - If the candidate is a **Moderate Fit** or **Not a Fit**, populate the **Alternate Role Suggestion** section. 
 - Keep output token-efficient, concise, and structured. 
 - Do **not** add any narrative or introductions. `;

 |----------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|
 | [Company]      | [Title] | [Month/Year – Month/Year] | [X years Y months] |

 - Use Month/Year format for all dates.
 - If the end date is written as "Present" or similar, use ${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'})} as the end date.
 - Calculate the precise duration for each role using actual start and end dates — no rounding.

 ---

 🔎 Employment Gap Analysis:

 - Analyze every transition from one job to the next — starting from the earliest role in the resume to the most recent.
 - For each transition, mention:
 - The end month of the previous job
 - The start month of the next job
 - The exact gap duration in months
 - Output even zero-month gaps, clearly marked as such (e.g., “0 months – No gap”).

 ✅ Example format:
 - Gap between April 2019 and May 2019 - 1 month
 - Gap between March 2022 and March 2022 - 0 months (No gap, as the transition is within the same month)

You must apply exact formatting, logic, and constraints as defined below. No additional commentary or format deviations are allowed.

### 🔒 Internal JD Skill Extraction (For Logic Use Only)
 
From the JD:
 
1. Extract all explicitly mentioned **skills, tools, or technologies**.
2. Internally assign **weights** based on phrasing:
 
| Phrase in JD                                        | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| “must have”, “mandatory”, “required”, “6+ years”    | 5      |
| “preferred”, “should have”, “recommended”           | 3      |
| “nice to have”, “familiarity with”, “exposure to”   | 1      |
 
> These weights are for internal logic only. **Do not display or explain** this table in the output.

### 📋 Resume Evaluation Logic (Apply Rigorously)
 
For each candidate resume:
 
1. Extract the **candidate's full name** from the resume content.
2. Extract and categorize all **skills, tools, or technologies** from the JD:
   - **Must-Have Skills** → based on high-weight phrases (e.g. “must have”, “mandatory”).
   - **Other Required Skills** → from lower-priority phrases (e.g. “preferred”, “nice to have”).
3. For each skill:
   - ✅ If **explicitly stated** in the resume, it is considered matched.
   - 🟡 If **clearly implied** by tools, context, or responsibilities, include in **Missing Skills** with (not clearly stated).
   - ❌ If **not mentioned or implied**, list in **Missing Skills**.
4. Internally calculate total missing weight (based on unlisted and implied skills).
5. Use the following logic to determine **Overall Fit**:
 
| Total Missing Weight | Overall Fit |
|----------------------|-------------|
| 0–5                  | ✅          |
| 6–11                 | ⚠️          |
| 12+                  | ❌          |

### 🧾 Candidate Skill Gap Evaluation Results
 
**Required Skills in JD:**  
- **Must-Have Skills:** Skill1, Skill2, Skill3  
- **Other Required Skills:** Skill4, Skill5
 
| Candidate Name | Missing Skills | Overall Fit |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| (Full Name)    | Skill2 (not clearly stated), Skill5 | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
 
---
 
### 🔍 Highlights
 
- Candidate [Full Name] has familiar experience with **Skill2**, but it was not explicitly mentioned. Related experience includes [brief evidence from resume].
- Candidate [Full Name] also shows indirect exposure to **Skill5** through prior work with [related tools or context].

### 📌 Follow-Up Summary
 
### 📌 Follow-Up Summary
 
✅ If at least one candidate is marked ✅:
 
- Candidate [Name] is a strong match, with all key required skills clearly mentioned.
- Critical skills like [SkillX], [SkillY] are explicitly present.
- Minor gaps are acceptable based on overall profile strength.
 
❌ If no candidate is marked ✅:
 
- There are no candidates classified as ✅ (matched profiles) based on explicit skill mentions.
- All candidates have skill gaps exceeding the acceptable threshold.

### ⚠️ Final Output Rules
 
- **Never display or mention internal skill weights.**
- **Clearly separate Must-Have and Other Required Skills** under “Required Skills in JD”.
- **Missing Skills** must only include skills not matched or not clearly stated.
- **In the 🔍 Highlights section, always use bullet points and bold the skill names**.
- **Strictly follow this output structure**:
 
  1. ### 🧾 Candidate Skill Gap Evaluation Results  
     - Show **Required Skills in JD** (grouped)  
     - Show candidate result table
